# E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the E-Commerce Website, an online platform where users can explore and purchase a wide range of products. This project consists of two parts: the front-end user website and the admin website. The E-Commerce Website is built using Next.js, Styled Components, JavaScript, and MongoDB for the user website, and Tailwind CSS, Axios, JavaScript, and MongoDB for the admin website. This combination of technologies provides a seamless and feature-rich shopping experience.

## Front-End User Website

The front-end user website offers a user-friendly interface with various features tailored to enhance the shopping experience:

### User Accounts

Users can create accounts on the E-Commerce Website to personalize their shopping experience. Registered users have access to features such as wishlists, order history, and saved payment information. This allows for a convenient and personalized shopping experience.

### Wishlist

To help users keep track of products they are interested in, the E-Commerce Website includes a wishlist feature. Users can add products to their wishlist, view them at a later time, and easily move them to the shopping cart for purchase.

### Product Search, Filter, and Category Selection

Efficient product search and filtering options are available on the website. Users can search for specific products by name, category, or other attributes. Additionally, advanced filtering options allow users to refine their search results based on price range, brand, and other customizable criteria. Moreover, users can select specific categories to browse products that fall into their preferred category.

## Admin Website

The admin website provides a comprehensive set of tools and functionalities to manage the e-commerce platform effectively:

### Dashboard

The admin dashboard offers a holistic overview of the e-commerce site, including key performance metrics, sales analytics, and user engagement data. This enables administrators to make informed decisions and track the overall performance of the business.

### Orders and Products Management

The admin website includes dedicated sections to manage orders and products. Administrators can view and process customer orders, update order statuses, and manage inventory. Additionally, product management features allow for easy addition, editing, and removal of products from the online catalog.

### Featured Products

To highlight specific products or promotions, the admin website provides the ability to mark products as "featured." Featured products can be displayed prominently on the front-end user website, attracting user attention and increasing visibility.

### Account Management and Google Login

The admin website includes account management functionality, enabling administrators to create and manage admin accounts with different levels of access. Additionally, the option for login via Google provides a convenient and secure authentication method for administrators.

Please note that due to sensitive information, such as user accounts, products, and orders, the source code for the admin page cannot be provided. This is to ensure the privacy and security of user data.

The E-Commerce Website, built with Next.js, Styled Components, JavaScript, and MongoDB for the user website, and Tailwind CSS, Axios, JavaScript, and MongoDB for the admin website, offers a comprehensive and user-friendly online shopping experience. With its range of features on the front-end user website and powerful tools on the admin website, this platform aims to provide a seamless and efficient e-commerce solution.
